<h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</h3>

<h3>Unit 2: Introducing First Order Logic</h3>

<h3>Unit 3: Agent Architectures</h3>
<p>
<b>Readings</b><br>
<a href="#maes">Maes, 1991</a> described systems of agents with different but interchangeable roles, 
with the ability to adjust their own importance to particular tasks.<br>
<a href="#kaelbling">Kaelbling, 1991</a> is about "the information content of the internal states of a machine."
One sentence that caught my eye on the first page was:
"the world may change during the computation, 
invalidating the initial semantic interpretation of the inputs, 
and possibly, therefore, the interpretation of the outputs."  So these agents need to be quick.  
Emphasis is put on the modular architecture and the incremental nature of software development.
It is made clear that this system is suitable for dynamic environments.
A distinction is made between dynamic data, which needs to be kept in individual machines,
and static data, which only needs to be in one instance, thereby reducing computing requirements.
Reference is made to <a href="#brooks">Brooks, 1991</a>, which is also in this week's reading list.<br>
<a href="#bratman">Bratman, 1988</a> discusses a combination of the weighing of alternatives, as in <a href="#maes">Maes, 1991</a>,
and "means-end reasoning," while bearing in mind "resource boundedness," which apparently means that agents:
"are unable to perform arbitrarily large computations in constant time."  
This recognises the problem I saw in <a href="#kaelbling">Kaelbling, 1991</a> about getting out of synch with the state of environment,
although a footnote on page 5 says that applying these systems to real-time situations was a relatively recent idea.
The paper goes on to describe how a planning function could reduce the computing requirement by limiting the necessary reasoning.
It sounds to me analogous to the shortcutting of an AND statement when the first argument evaluates to FALSE and the second argument is not evaluated.
Also, knowledge is also bounded so that machines "are neither prescient nor omniscient."
This bounding takes the form of filtering, e.g. by time frame, location or compatibility with existing plans.<br>
<a href="#brooks">Brooks, 1991</a> got me in a tangle over the year to include in the citation. This paper was received by <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>
in 1987 but not printed for four years, hence the year 1991 is cited. Perhaps this means that many papers are actually older than they seem.
This paper is about agents ("independent and parallel activity producers") that interface to the environment more than to each other.
There is an interesting declaration on the first page: "No one talks about replicating the full gamut of human intelligence any more. 
Instead we see a retreat into specialized subproblems." 
That may have been true in 1987 but today all those elements are being brought together again (<a href="#goertzel">Goertzel &amp; Pennachin, 2007</a>).
Brooks advocates an incremental approach, starting with fairly simple systems. He is effectively saying we have to walk before we can run.
By "no representation" Brooks is saying a system can make decisions by 
"using the world as its own model and to continuously match the preconditions of each goal against the real world."
I found this paper to be perhaps more optimistic than realistic, but that may be because I do not fully understand the mechanisms at work.<br>
Finally, <a href="#reynolds">Reynolds, 1987</a> discusses computer animation of a flock of birds, where 
"the aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds."
It is a similar problem to those in the first four papers. For these "boids" (simulated birds), three behaviours are identified: "collision avoidance..., 
velocity matching... and flock centering."  As with the other papers, computing is in LISP.
